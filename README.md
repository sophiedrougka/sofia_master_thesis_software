Master Science in Cybersecurity 

Athens University of Economics and Business 

This is repositroy in which i have uploaded all software that i have developped during my master thesis in Cybersecurity in Athens University of Economics and Business.

The software named "metadataAnalysis.py" reads the data from the .csv format in which it has been converted a .pcap file derived from the Wireshark tool. Particularly, this source code calculates the statistics on the minimum packet length, maximum packet length, average packet length and frequency of packets per protocol. Moreover, it analyzes the information concerning the information of each packet, which can be found in the "info" collumn of a .pcap file. The code also calculates the frequency of every source IP Address Finally, all the relevant diagrams are being produced from the above statistics. It worth mentioning that there is a function for every statistic calculation in this software.
